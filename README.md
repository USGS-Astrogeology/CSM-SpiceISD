# CSM-SpiceISD

This repository contains a library to support the generation of [Community
Sensor Model](https://github.com/sminster/csm)(CSM) compliant Image Support Data (ISD) using the NASA
Navigationand Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) [SPICE
toolkit](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html) and
associated Spice positional kernels. 

The ISD files generated by this library are designed to interface with the USGS
[CSM-CameraModels](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/CSM-CameraModel).

Currently, this is a very stripped down collection of Python scripts to
generate ISD for a single MDIS-NAC and MDIS-WAC image.  Future improvements and
expansion for full Spice search and support are planned.
