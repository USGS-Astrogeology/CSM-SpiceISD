# Python

In this directory we store ipython notebooks that have been used in development
for the creation of JSON ISD files.  These files are hard coded for a specific
NAC and WAC image and are therefore simply prototypes of the type of interface
that could be used to get NAIF Spice information into a format suitable for the
CSM.
